** 25th May: meet dean of department of informatics, University of technology, Santa Maria, we talk something about the development of ALMA database.
** 26th May: talk to Mr. Zhong Wang: report the contents of the talk yesterday.
** DONE I need to learn how to manage the wordpress website, it is not a big part of my work, but it would be a regular work.
** TODO Read the NGAS related document class.
* 2015/6/1~2015/6/5
** prepare for a talk about supernova dust on July 10th
** TODO learn to write a gaussfit function in python or matlab
** DONE learn to use emacs to organize the notes
** DONE learn to use git to synchronize my work
** TODO Read the NGAS related document class.
* 2015/6/8~2015/6/12
** 2015/6/8~2015/6/9: install oracle12c successfully after a long time and many efforts.
** start to write a small python script to do curve fit.
** TODO learn to be a DBA
* 2015/6/15~2015/6/19
** I spend too many time in database, I should spend sometime in doing research.
** Cent OS is more suitable for oracle database 12c.
** from 2015/6/16 I will spend at least 6 hours in astonomy.
** I spend more than 6 hours in astronomy since 6/16 this week, but
the progress is stil not as fast as I thought. Apparently, there is
more difficulties in doing astronomy research, I should work more hard
in order to survive in astronomy field.
** I think I should follow the history of a subject, for eg: organize
the history of dust and draw the branches from which all the modern
topic derived from I think it will be helpful to me in doing
researches in the field.
** I should find time to do sports everyday!
** The container of HPC has arrived at UTFSM, I probably will have to
spend some time on it. I am not sure how many time is needed every day
on average.
** I hope I can do some work with Lei Zhu, It is the fastest way to
get started in astronomy. I really need to work hard.
** I installed matlab on both mac and dell, I also learn how to use
pdepe package to solve partial diffusion equation.
* 2015/6/22/~2015/6/26
** I hope to do some data job with Lei Zhu.
** TODO write a gauss fit program in both python and matlab.
** TODO learn to write a gaussfit function in python or matlab
** DONE Read the NGAS related document class.
** DONE learn to be a DBA
** lean interferometry and basic radio astronomy, Lei Zhu give me a
small job that is to do image construction with 'CLEAN' method, so I
spend several days to learn why we need CLEAN algorithm and how to do
it.
** I sent a email to Prof. Wang because Lei Zhu and Wei Wang ask me to
do so, Prof. Wang know ADASS very well and he points out that the
meeting is not suitable for us to attend until our database has been
built successfully. Professor Wang also arrange Lei Zhu and me to go
to US to get some learning there which is a very good oppotunity for
me. I should be more active during the learning periods.
** just now I found the emacs should be split into two columns to gain
a better effiency, because the line-wrap is turned on.
** I need a account in ESO to access some files I need.
* 2015/6/30~2015/7/4
** TODO write a gauss fit program in both python and matlab.
** TODO learn to write a gaussfit function in python or matlab
** TODO learn how to use 'CLEAN' method in CASA
** TODO make preparation to report the recent progress to Prof. Wang.
* 2015/7/6~2015/7/10
** Originally lei zhu and I plan to go to nrao at charllotsville,
Virginia to study database technology, but nrao deferred our visit for
two weeks.
** I study image reduction technology from Lei Zhu and it is a good
oppotunity for me to begin my astronomy field.
** I begin to read SICP again, and I finished the first chapter, but I
should do the excecises myself, this will take me some time but will
certainly be benefit for me.
** I should stay calm and take things easy, the key to make good study
is to do it everyday and never stop.
** I already know how to clean the image now, this week I will finish
the image clean in orion
* 2015/7/13~2015/7/17
* 2015/7/20~2015/7/24
** these two weeks I spend most time in installing server, I make a
number of notes in how to install server on the HPC these are of great
value to me and the CASSACA
* 2015/7/27~2015/7/31
** I arrived the US, staying at Washington D.C. for 2 days, and pay a
visit to the air & space museum.
** On Thursday I came to charlottesville and it is a great place. 
** On Friday I came to NRAO, there is a BBQ here and I was introduced
to several people. Beers tastes good. 
** I will sign the contract on Saturday.
